# MyFlixAngularClient

This project was about building the client-side for a movie application based on its corresponding REST API and database created at an earlier time. This single page application allows users to create an account, see a list of all of the applicationâ€™s movies, add movies to and remove movies from a list of favorite, and update their user profile.
The project makes use of the MEAN tech stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), as well as Angular Material for building UI components.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
